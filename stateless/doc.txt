stateless :
here i took Draz app for  as stateless example
Statelessness in Daraz: Daraz uses a stateless architecture, which means the server does not remember user information between requests. Every time a user sends a request  all necessary information  is sent with the request. This way, the server doesn't need to store or recall user information from previous interactions, making each request independent.
